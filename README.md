A Fast Runtime Lua 5.1x+/Luau Project Bundler, Using Roblox Models and Module-Require Semantics

*Powered by [Lune](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune), a standalone Luau script runtime*

## üéâ About

Wax is an all-in-one bundler for projects in Lua 5.1x+ and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org), supporting and enforcing Roblox-like module require semantics (like using `require()` with a relative `script` global), and also normal `string` file paths like in generic Lua.

This is more of a successor to [Maui](https://github.com/latte-soft/maui), a similar, but much more limited and inherently flawed project for bundling Roblox projects, but **only** for running in Roblox. Wax, on the other hand, *bundles* completely outside of the Roblox engine, and generates code that can *run* outside it aswell. **Wax can 'bridge the gap' between traditional Lua projects and modern Roblox/Luau workflows, or anything in-between.**

### Features

*See [Usage](#üöÄ-usage) for more details on utilizing various features*

* Bundle directly from a [Rojo project](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/project-format) file (`*.project.json`), or just a generic Roblox model file. (`*.rbxm` or `*.rbxmx`) *For working directly with Rojo project files, you **must** have the `rojo` command in your $PATH*
* Created with **debugging in mind** from the start. *With output minification disabled*, even proper line info (matching to the original source files) can be shown in errors; for example, `[VirtualEnv].Script.OtherScript:1: intentional error`
* Built-in support for minifying bundled output directly with [Darklua](https://darklua.com) and either our default configuration (no extra steps), or your project's own `.darklua.json/json5` file for making personal tweaks.
* Localized/flattened modified globals in closures, meaning `getfenv`/`setfenv` aren't used out-of-the-box to modify the script's environment - This also means that in Luau, `safeenv` runtime optimizations are maintained, and closures run 'natively' with no user modification!
* Automated CI/deployment pipeline usage in mind, with the `ci-mode` flag; no user confirmation prompts, and exits with a `1` status code upon any errors
* A 'virtual' Roblox-like DOM for scripts that can run completely outside of Roblox, while also allowing module imports (`require()`) with a simulated relative `script` global, or traditional filesystem path strings like in [Lune](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune) or the Lua/Luau CLI REPLs.

Additionally, you can check out some example "projects" in our [tests](tests) directory if you don't really know what all of this is about, or how to get started..

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

For your project, you **must** have at least [Lune](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune) installed, most easily done and managed with [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman):

1. Goto Aftman's GitHub repository (linked above), and follow its installation instructions for your platform
2. Open the root directory of your project in your system's terminal, and run the following:

```
aftman init
aftman add filiptibell/lune
```

3. If you've setup Aftman properly, you can now try running `lune --help`, and if all is well you should see something similar to the following in your terminal:

```
$ lune --help
A Luau script runner

Usage: lune [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT_PATH] [SCRIPT_ARGS]...
```

### Add Wax to Your Lune Scripts

If you already have a "`lune`" or "`.lune`" directory or similar in your project, feel free to use that - for the sake of this example guide, I'm going to use "`lune`" as the directory for Lune scripts.

1. If you haven't already, create a directory named "`lune`" in the root of your project
2. Inside of this newly created directory, create a file named "wax.luau", and paste in the following:

```lua
--[[
    Wax - A Fast Runtime Lua 5.1x+/Luau Project Bundler, Using Roblox Models and Module-Require Semantics
    MIT License | Copyright (c) 2023 Latte Softworks <https://latte.to>
]]

-- You can also set the following string to "latest" (case insensitive), or any
-- other tag on Wax's releases page
local WaxVersion = "0.1.0"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

local net = require("@lune/net")
local luau = require("@lune/luau")

local FileLink = if string.lower(WaxVersion) == "latest" then
    "https://github.com/latte-soft/wax/releases/latest/download/wax.luau"
else `https://github.com/latte-soft/wax/releases/download/{WaxVersion}/wax.luau`

luau.load(net.request(FileLink).body)()
```

3. Now, when running `lune wax`, you should see something similar to what's in the next section ([Usage](#üöÄ-usage)) in your terminal. Voil√†!

## üöÄ Usage

From your terminal in the root directory of your project, run `lune wax`, or just `lune <path/to/wax.luau>`

```
Wax 0.1.0
A Fast Runtime Lua 5.1x+/Luau Project Bundler, Using Roblox Models and Module-Require Semantics

USAGE:
    lune wax [subcommand] [options]

* When no subcommand is provided, this usage message is displayed
* Provide all options in the following format (no "--" flag prefix): option=value

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help      Displays this usage message

    bundle    Builds a bundled script file from a given Roblox model (*.rbxm/*.rbxmx)
              or Rojo project file (*.project.json, requires the `rojo` command
              available in your PATH environment variable), to an output path

      OPTIONS for `bundle`:
      * input (REQUIRED*)
            The input Roblox model (*.rbxm/*.rbxmx) or Rojo project (*.project.json) file
            path for Wax to bundle from

      * output[={input-filename}.lua]
            The final output file path (must end in .lua or .luau) for the bundled script

      * minify[=false]
            If codegen output should be "minified", which also omits any runtime line
            debugging info (offsets). For 'full' codegen minification (outside of just
            LuaEncode's table output), you must have the `darklua` command available in
            your PATH environment variable.
            Additionally, with Darklua, if a ".darklua.json/json5" file isn't found in the
            CWD (your dir "position" in your terminal), it'll use the default configuration
            we provide (see `lune/lib/data/DefaultDarkluaConfig.luau`)
    
      * env-name[="[VirtualEnv]"]
            The name of the "environment" of the bundled script. This is the "name" of
            the root object (like the `game` DataModel in Roblox) and displays in virtual
            runtime errors (e.g. "[VirtualEnv].Script: Some error message")

      * temp-dir-base[={output-dir}]
            If you're providing a Rojo project file as input or minifying with Darklua,
            a temporary directory is created inside of this directory path, and is removed
            by the time Wax has completed processing

      * extra-offset-lines[=0]
            (Only applicable to when `minify` is set to false) Internally acknowledges
            any extra lines offset from the top of the script (like if you're adding a
            header of sorts to the codegen) for line debugging info. Ths MUST be exactly
            accurate to its name (*extra* lines, so you may want to do something like
            `#ExtraHeader - 1` if you're using this option)

      * ci-mode[=false]
            (*Primarily* for automated CI pipelines or deployment systems) Never gives
            any user input prompts, and will *always* exit with a `1` status code upon an
            'error' or warning during the build process

      * verbose[=true]
            "Verbose" (detailed) output logging from CLI/bundler
```
